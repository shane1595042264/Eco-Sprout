# EcoSprout: Mini Farm
Welcome to the magical world of EcoSprout, where farming is not just a chore but an adventure! Our farm introduces strategic farming that encourages sustainable farming practices. Our project is live at https://ecosprout.fun/. If the address is not working, you can still go to our Github repository page for local deployment. You can run the app by running `npm install` and then `npm start`. Remember to have Node.js installed on your computer too!
## 🌱 Inspiration

In a world where concrete jungles are overtaking green pastures, EcoSprout was born out of a dream to reconnect people with nature. Our inspiration comes from the joy of just watching the seed grow and fulfill our sense of achievement. We wanted to create a virtual farm where players of all ages can experience the wonder of farming, learn about sustainable practices, and have a ton of fun along the way!

## 🌾 What it does

*EcoSprout: Mini Farm* is an interactive game with user-friendly UI to help you manage a little farm with limited resource but infinite growth. Whether you're a single player looking for a serene farming experience or a double player ready for some friendly farming competition, EcoSprout has got you covered! 

## 🛠 How we built it

Our mini farm game was built by React with pure CSS. The reason we didn't use a lot of CSS frameworks and libraries is because we want to show everyone that even pure CSS can provide good UI/UX for a web game. Each element was designed by heart, from the interactive market to the easy-to-use inventory. The weather system also makes the farm more immersive to the players. 

## 🚜 Challenges we ran into

There are challenges making this little farm. We grappled with layout issues, battled bugs, and weathered the storm of debugging. For example, we had a hard time fixing the counter of our inventory to prevent it from decreasing the quantity by twice the amount of the consumption. But with the dedication of farmers, we were able to overcome them just like how farmers overcome the challenges of farming.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're brimming with pride over our interactive crop selection, dynamic weather system, and user-friendly UI. We designed the double player gamemode like a brand new chess game where players have to make decision that can determine win or lose. We're also proud of each team member's contribution to the project. We all worked together to make this project a success!

## 🌟 What we learned

Throughout this hackathon, we realized idea is more imporetant than actual programming. We spent 2 hours designing the game and the minimum viable product's requirements to make sure we have a clear goal. We also learned that communication is key to a successful project. We had a lot of fun working together and we're excited to continue our journey as a team.

## 🌻 What's next for EcoSprout: Mini Farm

The future is bright and green for EcoSprout! We plan to introduce more crops by designing an automated system to feed them into our game as warehouse, expand the marketplace with some tools like fertilizer and shovels, and integrate more sustainable farming practices like biological control. We're also exploring the idea of community events where players can come together and celebrate the joys of farming.
